# crud-climber-app
A full Crud Climber application. This experimental application is used for checking our climbing courses and adding them to your own personal scheduler 
using Authentication. A user can view upcoming climbing classes and is able to post a new class to the list for everyone to see. Each user can login and 
select certain classes they might want to try out or leave a review ext. This project is to demenstrate understanding and experimentation with Authentication,
model referencing, and full stack development.
