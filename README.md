# crud-climber-app

A full Crud Climber application. This experimental application is used for checking our climbing courses and adding them to our own personal scheduler
using Authentication. A user can view upcoming climbing classes on the main page where all classes are posted. You are able to post a new class to the list of classes for everyone to see. Each user can login and select certain classes they might want to try out or leave a review ext. This project is to demenstrate understanding and experimentation with Authentication,
full stack development, model referencing, and Authentication.
